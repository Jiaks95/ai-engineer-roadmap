# AI Engineering Roadmap: From Script to Agent

This repository documents my journey mastering AI Engineering through a structured, project-based roadmap. The goal is to move beyond simple scripts and build autonomous, intelligent agents that interact with the real world.

## The Roadmap

I am following a 5-phase plan, focusing on one core competency per phase.

### Phase 1: The Foundation (Data & Connectivity) *[In Progress]*
* **Focus:** Python mastery, HTTP/APIs, JSON handling, and Environment Security.
* **Lab:** Experiments with `requests` and data parsing.
* **Checkpoint Project:** **CLI Weather Fetcher** (A terminal tool that fetches live weather data).

### Phase 2: The Intelligence (LLM Fundamentals)
* **Focus:** Connecting code to LLMs (OpenAI/Anthropic), Prompt Engineering, and Context management.
* **Checkpoint Project:** **Terminal Chatbot with Persona** (A stateful CLI bot).

### Phase 3: The Memory (RAG & Vector DBs)
* **Focus:** Embeddings, Vector Databases, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
* **Checkpoint Project:** **"Chat with my Notes"** (A local RAG tool for querying documents).

### Phase 4: The Agency (Tools & Function Calling)
* **Focus:** Tool use, Function Calling, and Autonomous Loops.
* **Checkpoint Project:** **Autonomous File Organizer** (An agent that organizes files based on content).

### Phase 5: The Production (Deployment & UI)
* **Focus:** Docker, FastAPI/Streamlit, and Cloud Deployment.
* **Capstone Project:** **Full Stack AI Assistant** (Web-based interface for the agent).
